# Okanban

Objective: coding a Trello-type application.


- We want to create an application similar to Kanban apps where it is possible to create cards inside lists.
- The user can create as many lists as needed and add as many cards as needed to those lists.
- Each list has one name.
- Each card has one title, one position inside the list, one color (optional) and one or several tags (optional)

Based on this information, we analyse the needs and elaborate conception documents to answer those needs:

- the [MCD](doc/okanban.svg),
- the [user stories](doc/user_stories.md),
- the [MLD](doc/tables.md),
- the [data definition file](doc/create_tables.sql),
- the [seeding file](doc/seeding.sql)
